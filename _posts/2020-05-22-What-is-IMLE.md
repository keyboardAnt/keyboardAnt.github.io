Why do we care?

## What is IMLE?

A solution for *mode dropping* (*mode collapse*) problem in GANs.

a method from 2018 that solves all three problems mentioned above

This method is named *Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE)*[^7].

## How IMLE works?

## IMLE drawbacks

Unfortunately in practice synthesises blurry images[^9].

## Improvements that outperform GANs

Can be combined with other methods to outperform GANs (GLANN)
