Why do we care?

## What is GLO?

> *IMLE* is a generative model that maximise likelihood. IMLE solves: ① the [*mode dropping* (*mode collapse*) problem in GANs](/mode-dropping-problem-in-gans); ② the [vanishing gradient problem in GANs](/vanishing-gradient-problem-in-gans); and ③ the [training instability problem in GANs](/training-instability-problem-in-gans). In practice IMLE synthesises blurry images. Nevertheless, IMLE has its own strengths; it is utilised as a component of [a novel generative model that outperforms VAEs and GANs (named GLANN)](/what-is-glann).

> IMLE stands for *Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation*, since it deals with *implicit* probabilistic models (like deep neural networks).

## How GLO works?



## GLO drawbacks

Unfortunately in practice synthesises blurry images[^9].

## Improvements that outperform GANs

Can be combined with other methods to outperform GANs (GLANN)
